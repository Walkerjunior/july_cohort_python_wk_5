# Python OOP Assignment  

This repository contains solutions for two Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) activities:  

---

## **Activity 1: Design Your Own Class** üèóÔ∏è  

I created a **`Smartphone`** class that inherits from a parent **`Device`** class.  

### Features:  
- **Attributes:** brand, model, storage, battery.  
- **Methods:**  
  - `make_call(number)` ‚Üí Simulates calling a number.  
  - `browse_internet()` ‚Üí Simulates browsing.  
  - `phone_specs()` ‚Üí Displays full phone specifications.  
- **Inheritance:** The `Smartphone` class inherits `device_info()` from the parent `Device` class.

## **Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge** üé≠  

I implemented a `Vehicle` base class and created subclasses **Car, Plane, and Boat**.  
Each subclass overrides the `move()` method to reflect unique behavior.
